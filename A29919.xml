            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE moſt glorious and great Workeman, who excels all Wiſedome, and is beyond all underſtanding, the moſt potent, wiſe, and mercifull Father, who is the uniter of all creatures, and by whom they have their being, who is the moſt potent and moſt excellent, being before all things, and having no need of any thing, but being ſufficient in himſelf, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the moſt unſearchable cloſet of his Divinity, and out of his aboundant goodneſſe willing to bring foorth things thought and determined on from all Eternity, did in the beginning create a certain eſſence of things, being, as it were, ſcarce faſhioned into any ſhape, which by ſome is called the fountain or head from whence all other things flowed; by others, an empty plot of earth, producing nothing at all; by others, a Chaos; by ſome the mother of the world, the foundation of nature; but certainly the firſt he created was four Simples, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41683:10"/> are the four Elements of one and the ſame eſſence or matter, but of divers formes or qualities; and theſe, as I will ſhew heerafter more at large, are called Fire, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Earth, and Aire; and out of theſe he created all the reſt that now are, both the things that are above, and alſo thoſe beneath us: and that for this reaſon, becauſe the creatures intended to be made; might be extracted from a certaine root, whereby they might multiply and increaſe in the world. Therefore firſt of all God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the four elements, out of which he afterwards crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what he pleaſed: to wit, divers natures as the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are divers: for if the elements had been made all of one nature, then had all creatures been ſo likewiſe. Now of this firſt matter he created the Angels, which he made only of Fire, not of firm ſubſtantiall fire, for then it muſt have been neceſſary that they had eaten, drank, and ſlept; but he made them of the moſt pureſt and thinneſt part of pure, thin, and ſimple fire: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they neither eat, drink, nor ſleep. God created the Sun, Moon, and Stars of two elements, Aire, and Fire: and therefore are the Angels more bright, then either the Sun, Moon, or Stars, becauſe they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of one and that the moſt rare element; the other of Fire and Aire compounded.</p>
            <p>God made the Heaven of Water and Aire, ſo it is compounded of one rare or light element, that is Aire, and of another heavy, that is Water: but he created the Fowls and brute Beaſts of three elements, and alſo the Vegitables, that is to ſay, of Aire, Water, and Earth: certain are of the Earth and Aire; others of Fire, Aire, and Earth; of the laſt are the Fowls, and all things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in remaineth a ſpirit; of the firſt are the vegetables, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41683:10"/> all bruit Beaſts are of Earth, Aire and Fire, but the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables of Earth, Water, and Aire, and they likewiſe partake of a kind of thin Fire, brought in with the Aire; and therfore when we ſay that Fire is in the Vegetables, we mean that thin fire that being in the aire is carried by it and with it into them.</p>
            <p>God made Man of the four elements, as the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent peece of all his workmanſhip: he made him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own image naturally, according to his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude ſpiritually; and from hence the Ancients ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that there were four worlds: the firſt whereof was <hi>ultra mundanum,</hi> which the Divines call Angelical, and the Philoſophers Intellectuall: The next was, the Celeſtiall: The third, the Sublunar, which we inhabit: The laſt was Man, in whom all the reſt were found: whereto the Schoolmen alluding, call Man the <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſmos,</hi> or leſſer World, in whom there is a mixture of the four elements; a ſpirit celeſtiall, a vegetable ſoul, and the ſence and reaſon of brute beaſts, an angelicall minde, and finally the whole ſimilitude of God. Now as God hath made Man in this excellency, ſo he hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all theſe things under him, and ſo fitted them to his uſe, that there is no diſeaſe can happen to our bodies, whereto the earth brings not forth a convenient medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; and from hence ſprung the originall of Phyſick, whereof divers have attained to ſuch excellency, as that they have been worſhipped for Gods: therefore for the further inſtructing of thoſe that ſhall practice any of theſe my experiments, I have thought it convenient to publiſh ſuch notes as I have in my Studies gathered from the beſt Authours that have written concerning the laudable Science of Phyſicke, and the Practice
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41683:11"/> thereof, which ſhall ſerve as a compendious Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to my Booke.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Phyſick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</label> 
               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> called phyſicke an addition, and a ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: an addition of things neceſſary, and a ſubſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or taking away of the ſuperfluous. Wherein he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes two principall offices of a Phyſitian, for a diſeaſe proceeds either from too much emptineſſe, or from too much fulneſſe. The firſt whereof is cured by adding what is wanting, end the latter by taking away that which exceedes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> calls phyſicke a ſcience of the healthfull, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthfull, and neuters, which are neither well, nor can properly be ſaid to be ſicke: and this is made good three waies; as the body, as the cauſe, and as the ſigne; that body is counted healthfull that enjoyes his perfect health, that cauſe is healthfull that procures health and is the meanes of preſerving it. The healthfull ſigne doth ſhow or indicate the preſent health; the unhealthfull body is affected with a diſeaſe, which is generated by an unhealthfull cauſe, and the manner and greatneſſe of the griefe is ſhowne by the unhealthfull ſigne: a body is ſaid to be neither healthfull nor ſicke, when it is as it were declining and cannot be ſaid to be perfectly well, nor altogether ſicke.</p>
            <p>But the more vulgar and common definition of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke is this; Phyſicke is an art which preſerves health in the ſound, and reſtores it to the ſicke, and preſerves the neuters that are neither well nor ſicke; and from hence it is ſaid to be an art of things naturall; not naturall, and againſt nature, the former were according to the theory, theſe are according to the practique.</p>
            <p>Things naturall doe agree with our nature, and are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41683:11"/> thoſe things whereof our body is compacted and made, and are in number ſeven, <hi>viz.</hi> Elements, Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Humours, Members, Faculties, Operations, and Spirits. Things not naturall are thoſe meane and indifferent things whereby the body is preſerved in health, and are ſix in number: Aire, Meate and Drinke, Sleepe and Watching, Labour and Reſt, Fulneſſe and Emptineſſe, or repletion and inanition, and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the minde. Things againſt nature are thoſe that doe deſtroy our health, and are of three ſorts: A Diſeaſe, the cauſe of a Diſeaſe, and a Symptome. Hereby you may underſtand the two parts, of Phyſicke; Theoricke, and Practique; and by the Theoricke know every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and the quality thereof; and by the Practique to preſerve health and cure a diſeaſe, by the due admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of things not naturall, and by removing of thoſe that are againſt nature.</p>
            <p>Things naturall, and which properly belong to the conſtitution of our body are (as I ſaid before) in number ſeven:

                  <label>An Element what it is.</label> 
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N Element is the moſt leaſt, and ſimple portion whereof any thing is made, and in the deſtruction thereof is laſtly reſolved; which to ſay plainely, the foure firſt and ſimple bodies which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate and ſubject themſelves to the generation of all manner of things, be the mixture perfect or imperfect. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called the Heaven an Element, counting five parts of the world, Heaven, Fire, Aire, Water, and Earth. Of Elements we reckon foure, whereof two are groſſe and heavy, and move downewards, as Earth and Water; and two are light, and ſtrive upwards, as Fire and Aire. Earth is a ſimple body whoſe naturall place is the center of the univerſe, in which it naturally remaines ſolid, and ſtill round as an apple, in the middle whereof (as the antient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher writes) is the pit of hell, like as the blacke kernels lyeth in the midſt of the apple, and at the day of doome when all things ſhal be renewed, then ſhall this Element be made a thouſand fold more tranſparent and brighter then the Chriſtall or any pretious Stone, that they that are in the bitter paines of hell (to their encreaſe of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſhall through it behold the blisfull joyes of heaven, which will be more paine to them then all the torments of hell. Earth is of nature cold and dry.</p>
               <p>Water is alſo a ſimple body whoſe naturall place is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41683:12"/> to compas the earth; it is light in reſpect of the earth, but heavie in reſpect of the fire and aire: therefore <hi>Reolanus</hi> ſaith, that the earth holds the loweſt part, becauſe of it's heavineſſe, and the fire becauſe it is abſolutly light, hath the higheſt place: the aire and water becauſe they are, as it were, equally heavie or light, have the middle place: water being heavier then the ayre, lighter then the earth: the nature of water is cold and moiſt.</p>
               <p>Aire is a ſimple body, whoſe naturall place is above the Water, and under the Fire, and is by nature hot and moiſt.</p>
               <p>Fire is alſo a ſimple body, whoſe naturall place is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the elementary parts, becauſe it is a hollow ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Heavens, and by its abſolute lightneſſe, ſtriveth upward even to Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its nature is hot &amp; dry; theſe are ſo contrary in nature, that they cannot be joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without a meane, which is a temperament which fals out next to be treated of.</p>

                     <label>What is a Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</label> 
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Temperament therefore is a concord or mixture of the former diſagreeing ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or a mixture of hot, cold, moiſt, and drie.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe temperaments which are in number nine, eight are called diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and one temperate.</p>
                  <p>The temperate is alſo devided either to temperature
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41683:13"/> of weight or temperature of juſtice, but we call it not a temperature to weight wherein the elements are ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a like heape or weight, but where it is exquiſitely made temperate by the equall mixture of the foure firſt qualities, wherein no quality exceeds, but wherein all equality is included, and that as if it were put in a ballance it drawes downe neither to this nor that parte.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Secundum juſtitiam.</label> A temperament to juſtice is that which is conveniently temperate to the vſe that nature hath appointed and deſtinated it, therefore all thoſe things that have taken from nature a mixture of the elements (though une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, yet agreeable to motion and uſe) are called tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments <hi>ſecundum juſtitiam,</hi> as if wee ſee any living creature that performes the functions of nature aptly and as is ought to doe, we ſay he hath a temperament <hi>ſecundum juſtitiam,</hi> according to juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The diſtemperate temperament is double, ſimple and compound; the ſimple wherin one only quality exceeds the other two contemperate, as hot, cold, moiſt, dry, hot in which the heate hath the dominion over the cold (the moiſt and drie, being temperate) cold, in which the cold excels the heate (the other two being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.)</p>
                  <p>The compound in which two qualities exceed, and this is hot, and moiſt, or hot and drie, cold and moiſt or cold and drie; for the firſt qualities may be joyned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves ſix manner of waies, but heate cannot be joyned with cold, nor moiſture with drineſſe, becauſe they are in themſelves contrary, neither can they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine together in one ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Heere may be added the temperatures of the ſeaſons
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41683:13"/> of the yeere, which are four; Spring, Summer, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, and Winter, and are in nature hot, cold, moiſt, and drie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Spring.</label> The Spring is the moſt temperate, as being neither too cold and moiſt, as the Winter, nor too hot and dry, as the Summer: from hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> cals the Spring the moſt healthfulleſt time of the yeere, and leſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to dangerous diſeaſes, then any other ſeaſon; for it never breeds any diſeaſe, but onely produces ſuch as have been breeding in the body all the Winter prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Summer.</label> Summer is hot and drie, and a breeder of cholericke diſeaſes, which proceed from too much bloud, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Spring, and now become aduſt, and theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are for the moſt part ſpeedy in running their courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Autumne.</label> The Autumn is very unequall, for when it is drie it hath great inequality of heat and cold; the mornings and evenings being very cold, and the noondaies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hot, whereby many long and dangerous diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ingendred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Winter.</label> The Winter is cold and moiſt of temper; it excites naturall heat and appetite, and augments phlegme. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner are we to conſider the ages of man which are agreeable to the four quarters of the yeere.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N humour is whatſoever is moiſt, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid in ſubſtance, into which the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment is firſt converted in the body of living creatures endewed with bloud, and is called an humour, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all of them have one, and the ſame force of moiſtning, but becauſe all of them have a fluent ſubſtance. For choler and melancholy (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Reolanus</hi>) are drie humours; humours becauſe of their liquid conſiſtence, and drie becauſe they have the naturall force of drying. The humours are the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten matter, out of the mixture of the four elements; choler of fire; phlegme of water; melancholy of the earth; bloud of the aire; for it is hot and moiſt, as the aire. An humour is either elementary, alimentary, or excrementitious: elementary, is the pureſt parts of the ſeed; alimentary, is that which is generated of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment in the body, by the native heat, and mixed in the veines by the name of bloud; but not only bloud, for it hath a mixture of the three other humours although the greateſt part be bloud, and of theſe are produced the ſecond humours, <hi>inominata,</hi> or without name, <hi>ros</hi> dew, <hi>gluten,</hi> which is <hi>ros</hi> condenſed, and cambion: excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, which is either profitable, and neceſſary, as cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the gall, melancholy in the ſpleen, ſpittle in the jawes, and milke in the dugs; or unprofitable as urine,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41683:20"/> ſweate, excrement of the noſe, and menſtruous blood.</p>
               <p>The alimentary Humour (as I have ſaid) which is fit to nouriſh the body, is that humour which is contained in the veines, and arteries of a man, who is temperate, and perfectly well in health, and is knowne by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall name of Blood, which is let out at the opening of a veine, though it be in divers parts of the body unlike, and different, for the thicke blood which is in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, is not an humour, but is melancholy blood; the light froth that ſwimmes on the top is not Choller, but cholericke blood, unleſſe it be changed by nature into choller, and melancholy, which often it is, and from the blood is knowne, becauſe being out of its veſſels, it will congeale, but the humour never at all; for blood otherwiſe taken is an humour of a certaine kinde, deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by heat, and warmth, from the other humours comprehended with it in the whole maſſe of the blood.</p>
               <p>Blood in complexion is hot, and moiſt, rather tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, incolour Red, Roſie, or Crimſon; in ſmell, not ſtinking, in taſte ſavoury, of indifferent conſiſtence, neither too thicke, nor too thinne, and is of the nature of three ſignes of the Aire, <hi>Gemini, Libra, Aquarius,</hi> and hath its originall in the very firſt minute of our creation, and is encreaſed by the meate we eat, being drawne into the bottome of the ventricle, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained untill by force of concoction it is turned into a thicke ſubſtance of colour according to the meate we eat, much like in conſiſtence to almond butter, and this is called the Chylus which is formed round, that it may be the better ſucked out, for were it like a trough, that which was before concocted would be over much, whiles the other is ſucked out. This Chylus ſeeming
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41683:20"/> one, and the ſame thing in its ſelfe, yet conſiſts of parts of a different nature, either by reaſon of the variety of meats, or by one, and the ſelfe ſame meate; this being perfectly concocted, is received by the <hi>vena porta,</hi> or gate veine, and driven from thence into the ſmall guts, and ſucked in by the meſeraick veines, &amp; ſo enters the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, where (as ſome have thought) it gets no tincture, or rudiment, but it (being before coloured) gives colour to the liver, which otherwiſe is a thing of another kinde, and of a farre different colour, and from thence it enters the heart, where it is perfected; for they are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, who imagine the blood to have its originall in the liver, for in Embrioes you may ſee the heart, and all the veſſels made before they live, and an Egge in foure and twenty houres will be blood, and then a Chicken; ſo the bloud is the firſt that is made; and of this maſſe of blood are all the other humours made at one, and the ſame time: The blood being thus compoſed is devided into two parts, naturall, and unnaturall. Naturall which I have already ſhewed you is either arteriall contained in the arteries, or venall, contained in the veines, the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall is more red, cleare, ſubtle, hot, and flowing from an opened artery in a violent maner: the venall beats not, &amp; is leſſe red then the other, darker of colour, thick, &amp; not ſo hot. Vnnaturall is in quality by infection, or commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with an humour, it is unnatural in quality, when it is changed from its good complexion, &amp; is either too hot, or too cold, too thicke, or too thinne, or more ſubtle then it ſhould be; by infection when that ſome part of the bloud is evidently infected, and putrified by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture with another humour; that is, when there is more of another humour then ought to be, either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41683:21"/> when the evill humour encreaſes outwardly on the bloud, or inward when an evill humour g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And to conclude, bloud is (no queſtion) the firſt amongſt other humors, towards the beginning, and ſuſtaining of mans lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Blood is the matter containing the ſpirits, of which the life, and every operation of the vegetative vertue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41683:21"/> conſiſts, whether vitall, or animall, and it may very well challenge to its ſelfe the principall place being farre more convenient then any of the other humours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintaining of life, by reaſon of its heate, and moiſture, and becauſe it more nouriſhes the body, and more weakens it by its loſſe; for it is the treaſure of life through the loſſe whereof followes death immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
               <p>Thoſe in whom this humour abounds are beautified with a freſh and roſie colour, gentle and well natured, pleaſant merry, and facetious; it is beſt generated in the ſpring, and accordingly in youth, that is to ſay, from the five and twentieth yeare to the thirtieth yeare of age.</p>
               <p>The blood thus brought to the liver as before, muſt of neceſſity be purged from his too excrementitious humours, whereof the bladder of the gale drawes one, which we call yellow choller, and the ſpleene the other which we call melancholy; which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and excrementitious, but not alimentary, or nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing; but we will leave theſe for a while, and ſpeake of phlegme, which hath the next place to blood, becauſe it is neerer the radicall moiſture.</p>

               <p>Phlegme is of the nature of the three ſignes of the water, <hi>Cancer, Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Piſces,</hi> and is watry cold and moiſt, of conſiſtence liquid; of colour white; of taſte, ſweete, or rather unſavory, fit to nouriſh the braine, and all other cold, and moiſt parts, to make the bloud temperate, and to yeild moiſtneſſe to the joynts: It is placed in the body either of neceſſity, or for profit; of neceſſity two waies, whereof the firſt is common: the ſecond particular: The common is that phlegme which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41683:23"/> is neereſt the members, and by which they are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed when at any time they ſhall have loſt their proper nouriſhment good blood; neither doth it nouriſh, but when it is ſent into the bloody veines by the liver; the particular, is the mingling of it with the blood, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring it and making it fit to nouriſh the phlegmaticke parts, as the braine and nerves: for to nouriſh theſe a great part or portion of phlegme is required: for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit likewiſe two waies, whereof the firſt is likewiſe common, the other particular; the common whereby it makes the blood the more thinne, flowing, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, the eaſier to ſlide through the veines into the members; the particular, that it may moiſten the joynts and members that are moſt moved in the body, leaſt by continuall motion they become dry, becauſe every lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call motion is a ſtraining and heating, and every heate is reſolutive and deſiccative; therefore that the joynts of the bones by continuall motion, which is made by the ſinewes and muſcles, ſhould not be over heat, dried, and conſequently made quite unfit for the naturall uſe and motion; nature hath ordained theſe phlegmaticke humours, which as it were diſtilling out of the veines, doe water and moiſten them; not unlike the oyling the Axel-tree of a Coach, without which it would (as we ſee by daily experience) be burned into duſt; but this office of this humour is not profitable nor neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for every one, for infantes, and weake impotent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that can neither walke nor worke, but ſit idle, doe not need this moiſture; but thoſe that labour hard, and go much, have extraordinary need of it.</p>
               <p>Phlegme maketh a man drowſie, dull, fat, and ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and haſtneth gray haires; it abounds moſt in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

               <p>
                  <label>Choller.</label> The next is Choller, which is an humour hot and dry, of thinne, and ſubtle ſubſtance, and is, as it were, a certaine heate, and fury of humours, which generated in the liver, together with the blood is carried by the veines and arteries through the whole body; that of it which abounds is ſent partly into the guts, and partly into the bladder of the gall (which is its proper recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, and is in the hollowneſſe of the liver) or is conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by tranſpiration and ſweats: Choller is devided into two parts, naturall, and unnaturall: <label>Naturall choller.</label> The Naturall is, as it were, the froth of the blood, whoſe colour is of a cleare red turning towards yellow, and hath its originall from the more ſubtill parts of the Chylus. <label>Vnnaturall.</label> Unnaturall is by infection and commixtion of another humour, or by alteration; and it is called unnaturall when it is either greene, blacke, or darke red of colour: that kinde of unnaturall Choller which is made by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with another humour is called Vittelline, <label>Vittelline.</label> becauſe in heate and conſiſtence it is like the yolkes of egges; and this <hi>Avicen</hi> thinkes to be made of thicke phlegme mingled with choller; but <hi>Gallen</hi> thinkes it to be only by alteration, and a ſtronger heate deſtroying the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; for any humour deprived of its moiſture, muſt needs wax thicke; and this is the moſt received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for choller waxes pale and cold by the mixture of phlegme. Theſe other following are made only by alteration, <hi>viz.</hi> Leeke coloured, <label>Leeke-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured.</label> or reſembling the juice of a leek in greenes, tending towards black, which is generated in the ventricle by the crudity of meats, and therefore is ſometimes called greene phlegme: Aerugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <label>Aeruginous.</label>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:41683:24"/> of the collour of Verdigreace tending towards white; for according to <hi>Avicen,</hi> it is made of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid greene being more aduſt by the ventricle or liver inflamed, as bones being burned are firſt blacke, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards turne white<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſo hot and biting that it burnes like to hot poiſon. To theſe we may adde blew <label>Blew.</label> choller much like in colour to the herbe Woad that our dyers uſe; and to this alſo belongs that which is called Skie-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, <label>Skie-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or Sea-greene.</label> or Sea-coloured, and is the worſt of all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, except blacke choller, for it gets ſo much acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony by reaſon of the heat, that it corrodes, and ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; this kinde is generated in the ventricle, or neare about it: Red <label>Red.</label> choller is improperly called Red, being rather blood; only this is the difference, blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geales when it is out of its veſſels, but red choller will not: it is made red by being mingled with ſome bloudy moiſture; and it is made pale almoſt to the likeneſſe of naturall choller, by the mixture of phlegme. Blacke <label>Black.</label> choller ſo much degenerates from the naturall, as that it acquires the name of another humour, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called melancholy, of which we will ſpeake in his place. You ſhall underſtand, that that part of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall choller that goeth with the blood through the veines, is ſent thither for two ſpeciall reaſons, which we may call neceſſity and profit; of neceſſity, becauſe it is requiſit and needfull that the cholericke members be nouriſhed by it, whereto agreat part of choller is required: Secondly, for profit, that it may ſubtle the blood in the veines, and make itth more penetrating in its paſſage.</p>
               <p>Another part of naturall choller is ſeperated from the maſſe of humours generated in the liver, and is ſent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41683:24"/> to the bladder of the gall, of neceſſity, and for profit: of neceſſity, that the whole body may be purged, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and mundified from cholericke ſuperfluities; for the gall either by its owne property, or by the naturall attractive vertue, doeth draw unto it choler, as a thing moſt fit and proper for it ſelf, even after the maner of the Loadſtones drawing of iron; which kind of delight in attracting; is eſtabliſhed in a certaine hidden ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, which nature hath ordained betweene choler, and the bladder of the gall; by whoſe attraction the whole body, and likewiſe the bloud is cleanſed and mundified from all ſuperfluous choler, which otherwiſe might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the health: ſecondly for profit; firſt that it may waſh the inteſtines from dregs, and viſcous phlegm; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to pricke and ſting the guts, and muskles of the belly, that they may feele that it is hurtfull for them, and therefore may endevour to expell it; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive faculty doth not exerciſe it ſelfe in expelling the dregs remaining in the belly and guttes, unles it be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by choler flowing thereunto, whereby it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the paſſages betweene the gall and the guts being ſtopped, the colicke enſues.</p>
               <p>Choler is chiefly bred, and expelled in youth; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cride, and bitter meats yeeld matter to it, but great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of body and mind give the occaſion. It maketh a man nimble, quicke, ready for any performance, leane, and much ſubject to anger, and quicke of concoction.</p>
               <p>Choler is of the nature of the three ſignes of the fire, <hi>Avies, Leo,</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> and is fiery hot and drie; of conſiſtence thin; of colour yellow, or pale; or taſte bitter: it provoketh the expulſive faculty of the guts, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuates the phlegme cleaving to them; but the alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41683:25"/> is fit to nouriſh the partes of like temper with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Melancholy.</label> Melancholy or the melancholy humour being the groſſer portion, and as it were the mud and dregges of the bloud, is partly ſent from the liver to the ſpleene to nouriſh it, and partly carried by the veſſels into the reſt of the body, and ſpent in the nouriſhment of the parts endewed with an earthly dryneſſe; it is an enemy to mirth and jollity, and neere kinſman to death; and is by the ancients devided into two parts as phlegme is, that is naturall, <label>Naturall melancholy.</label> and unnaturall; the naturall is cold and drie, and is generated in the Chilus paſſing as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Vnnaturall melancholy.</label> The unnatural is not like the dregs of blod, but it is like the lees of wine burnt, hotter &amp; lighter then naturall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy is, and taks its originall from any of the humors aduſt; as from choller aduſt turned into melancholy, which only amongſt all the humours reſerves its owne proper taſt, that is bitter; from phlegme aduſt, which phlegme if it be watery and very ſubtle, then the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy thereof generated will be ſalt; which if it be not ſalt, then the melancholy will be acide, and ſharpe; from bloud aduſt, and this kind of melancholy is ſalt having alſo ſome little ſweetneſſe; for bloud is the treaſure of nature, and moſt diligently preſerved by the other humours, whereby it ſeldome happens that it is wholy, and totally aduſt, becauſe it retaines ſome ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes from naturall melancholy aduſt, from whence it happens that if the naturall melancholy from whence this unnaturall melancholy proceeds be ſubtle then this melancholy ariſing from the aduſtion will be even as ſharp as vineger, and being caſt on the ground turnes into bubbles; and this is the worſt of all the kindes of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41683:25"/> melancholies, and is called <hi>atra bilis;</hi> 
                  <label>Atra bilis, or blacke me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</label> for it not only corrodes the parts whereinto it is gathered, but whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it touches it burnes and ſcaldes, as powerfully as Lime, Aſhes, or burnt Lees of Wine, wherein ſome reliques of fire remaine; hereby it happens that a diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery cauſed by this humour is deadly, becauſe it ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the inteſtines; now blood aduſt, melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and <hi>atra bilis</hi> may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed; for from blood aduſt ariſe carbuncles; from melancholy ſchirrous tumours; and from <hi>atra bilis</hi> is generated can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; and of this laſt the ſmell is ſo contagious, that the very flies doe ſhunne it; but if that naturall melancholy be groſſe, then that which proceeds from it by aduſtion will be of farre leſſe ſharpneſſe.</p>
               <p>A part likewiſe of naturall melancholy paſſeth along with the blood, of neceſſity, and for profit; of neceſſity that it may be mingled with the blood in that quantity, and proportion as is neceſſary and requiſite to nouriſh ſome members, which are maintained by a great porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of melancholy, as the bones, and other cold, and dry melancholy members: Secondly for profit that it may attenuate the groſſeneſſe of the blood, and ſtrengthen, and conſolidate it untill it becomes a ſolid part of ſuch hard members as it ought to nouriſh.</p>
               <p>A part of naturall melancholy is alſo ſent unto the ſpleene, the blood having no need thereof, which is done for the aforeſaid cauſes. The firſt is univerſall, for it is very neceſſary the whole body ſhould be purged of ſuperfluous melancholy; and alſo particular, becauſe it ought to nouriſh a particular member, that is the ſpleen. The ſecond is of the melancholy that flowes to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the ſtomacke, and by his ſtipticity ſtraining,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41683:26"/> and as it were milking out the moiſture it there findes, as a woman ſtraines and preſſes out the milke from the Cowes teates with her fingers, and this profit ariſes two ſeverall waies; firſt when melancholy bindes, unites, and ſtrengthens the orifice of the ſtomacke that the meate may be the better retained therein; ſecondly where ſuch melancholy by his acridneſſe makes a kinde of commotion in the mouth of the ſtomacke, whereby the deſire of meate is excited and ſtirred: for after the mouth of the ſtomacke is thus moved, a kinde of gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping followes (as ſaith <hi>Iames de Forlivio</hi>) which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſenſitive faculty perceiving is excited to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of meate, whereby that griping is ended</p>
               <p>Melancholy is made of meates of groſſe juice, and by the perturbations of the minde turned into feare and ſadneſſe: it is augmented in the firſt, and crude old age; it makes men ſad, harſh, conſtant, froward, envious, and fearefull; it is of the nature of the three ſignes of the earth, <hi>Taurus, Capricorne,</hi> and <hi>Virgo,</hi> and is of nature earthly cold and dry; of conſiſtence groſſe, and mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; of colour blackiſh; of taſte acide, ſower, and biting; ſtirres up the appetite, nouriſhes the ſpleene, and all the parts of like temper to it, as the bones, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be doubted but that theſe humours doe move, and rule at certaine ſet houres of the day and night, as by a certaine peculiar motion or tide; for the blood flowes from the ninth houre of the night to the third houre of the day, as in the ſpring time: Choler to the ninth of the day, as in ſummer: Melancholy to the third of the night, as in autumne; the reſt of the night that remaines is under the dominion of phlegme, as in winter, whereof manifeſt examples appeare in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41683:26"/> French Pox, &amp;c. And theſe things thus underſtood, you may know what humour raigneth in the ſicke, and at what time he ſhall he moſt grieved. <label>The ſecond humours.</label> Next I ſhall ſhew you what the ſecond humours are which as I told you are likewiſe foure.</p>

This moiſture is properly called <hi>Ros</hi> from the likeneſſe it hath to dew, becauſe as dew falleth upon the earth, moiſtneth it, and adminiſters nouriſhment to the plants, ſo this moiſture doth at times of neceſſity, yield nouriſhment to the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring member; but not true ſubſtantiall nouriſhment, becauſe it hath not in it ſelfe ſolid ſubſtance ſufficient to be made part of a member; but it is in a kinde of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way, which is called a refreſhing: Further ſeeing that this moiſture is partly watry, partly airy and fat, therefore when it waters the members being by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reſolution dry, the eaſier is that joyned to the members which they call <hi>Cambium,</hi> then if they had ſtill remained dry, for moiſt to moiſt makes an union.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <label>What a member is.</label> THE Members are bodies ingendred of the firſt commixtion of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, humours, and ſpirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conſiſt of a ſolid, fleſhy, and ſpirituous ſubſtance. By partes in generall, I underſtand the head, breaſt, belly, and their adjuncts; by the particular partes of thoſe I underſtand the ſimple ſimilar partes, which are in number only eight, bones, griſtles, fibres, liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, membranes, tendones, ſimple fleſh, and skin, ſome adde to theſe, vaines, arteries, fat, marrow, nailes, and haires, others omit them as excrements: theſe aforeſaid are called ſimple rather in the judgment of ſenſe, then of reaſon, for all are nouriſhed, have life, and ſenſe, either manifeſt, or obſcure.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A bone.</label> A bone is earthly, drie and hard, that they may the better ſerve in the foundation of the whole body, and uphold it as pillars; and this ought not to be all one bone, but divided into divers partes that the body may with eaſe bend its members, which way neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; of theſe ſome are hollow, and ſome ſolid; the firſt nouriſhed by marrow, the laſt by a thick bloud en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring by the pores, as may be perceived in broken bones which are united by a Callus, which is generated of the reliques of the alimentary bloud.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41683:30"/>
               <p>
                  <label>A griſtle.</label> A griſtle is the ſame in ſubſtance, that a bone is of, and is meerly a ſoft bone, that may be cruſhed; as the bones of children are but griſtles, untill the heate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing with age doth harden them into bones; griſtles doe differ in themſelues, for ſome are at the ends of the bones, as in the huckle bone, noſe, ſternon, and knots of the ribs; others without bones, as in the eares, the flap of the weaſell, throtle, <hi>aſpera arteria,</hi> and baſis of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A ligament.</label> As a bone is harder then a griſtle, ſo is a griſtle harder then a ligament, which ſerves only to hold the bones together, which otherwiſe would ſlip aſunder; it is in colour and ſubſtance very like a nerve, but harder; and altogether without ſenſe and feeling, excepting ſome few, which either receive the nerves, or have their originall from the ſenſible membranes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A tendon.</label> A tendon is the end and taile of the arbitrary muſcles, and the firſt inſtrument of motion, and is called a tendon from the latin <hi>Tendendo,</hi> becauſe it ſtretches like a cord, when the member is moved; it is ſo much ſofter then a ligament, as it is harder then a nerve; it feeeles, and is moved by a voluntary motion by reaſon of the nerves, but by reaſon of the ligaments, it knits the muſcles to the bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A fibre.</label> A fibre is a ſmall thred, but firme and ſtrong, which nature hath placed in the muſcles, that ſo the body may move every way; the right fibres do draw, the tranſverſe do put back, the oblique do hold, every one helpes one another, as if you ſhould hooke your fingers one within another.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.</label> A membrane and a coate differ onely in this, a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41683:31"/> is a name of ſubſtance, a coat is a name of office, for where a membrane inveſts any part, it is called a coate; in ſome parts it hath a proper name, as that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volues the bones is called the perioſteum, that which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the braine pan is called the pericranion, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the braine, is called the mevinx, that which covers the ribs, and the contained parts as the heart, lights, and <hi>aſpera arteria</hi> is a proper coate, and is called a compaſſing membrane; that which containes the naturall parts, and gives to every one his proper coat, is called peritone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, and from theſe the parts have feeling; for if you ſcrape the perioſteum from the bone, you may cut the bone, burn it, or any thing without any paine.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Skinne.</label> The skin is the greateſt of all the membranes; it is the coat covering all the body, except ſuch places by which any excrements are evacuated; as the eies, eares, noſe, privities, fundament, mouth, and ends of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, where the nailes grow; it is the ſluce of the whole body, through which it is purged by ſweat, from all fulginous excrements; of ſubſtance it is ſpermaticke, for being once loſt it cannot be reſtored as formerly it was, but there remaines a skar, which is nothing els but fleſh dried beyond meaſure; it takes its feeling from the nerves, of which (together with veines and arteries) it is compoſed, and is by nature cold and drie, ordained for to keep ſafe and ſound the continuity of the whole body, and all the parts thereof from the violent aſſault of all externall dangers.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Simple fleſh.</label> Simple fleſh may be ſeene in the gummes and ends of the fingers; the fleſh of a muſcle is very like theſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ppes and ſtones, it is called glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous fleſh, and the ſubſtance of the heart and liver is called fleſh, but improperly.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41683:31"/>
               <p>
                  <label>Fat.</label> Fat, and fleſh proceed both from one and the ſame matter that is blood; the difference is, that fleſh comes of blood, heate, and overdried; the fat from cold by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine congealing or growing together of membranes, it is of a middle temper betweene heat and cold, although it may ſeeme cold in reſpect of the efficient cauſe that is of cold by which it concreates; in the joynts is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of fat farre more ſolid, and hard then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and it is mixed with a viſcid humour, tough like the whites of Egs, that it may for a good ſpace moiſten thoſe parts which are ſubject to much drines by their continuall motion; another kinde of fat is called ſeame, <label>Seame.</label> which is much dryer then ordinary fat, and lyes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally about the midriffe, where there are many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of arteries and veines; it lyes alſo about the reines, loynes, and baſis of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Compound members.</label> Thoſe parts are called compound, which are made and compoſed by the mediation, or immediately of the ſimple, which they terme otherwiſe organicall, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall; as an Arme, Leg, Hand, Foote, and others of that kinde: the ſimple parts cannot be devided into any particles, but of the ſame kinde; but the compound may: they are called inſtrumentall and organicall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they performe ſuch actions of themſelves, as ſerves for the preſervation of themſelves, and the whole body; as the eye by it ſelfe, not aſſiſted by any other part, ſeeth, and by his faculty defends the whole body, and alſo it ſelfe: In each inſtrumentall part we obſerve foure properties; One by which the action is properly performed, as the Chriſtaline humour in the eye: The Second without which the action cannot be perfomed, as the nerve &amp; the other humors of the eye: The Third,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41683:32"/> whereby the action is better and more conveniently done, as the tunicles, and muſcles: The Fourth, by which the action is preſerved, as the eye-lid and circle of the eye: The ſame we ſay of the hand, as Firſt, by the muſcle: Secondly, by the ligament: Thirdly, by the bones and nailes: Fourthly, by the veines, arteries, and skinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall parts.</label> The inſtrumentall parts have a fourefold order; thoſe that are immediately compoſed of the ſimple, are of the firſt order, as the muſcles and veſſels: they are of the ſecond that conſiſt of the firſt ſimple, and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as the fingers: they are of the third, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the ſecond order, and others beſides, as the hand in generall: The fourth order is, the whole body the inſtrument of the ſoule. In all theſe parts, whether ſimple or compound, we doe conſider nine things, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Quantity, Figure, Compoſition, Number, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, Temperature, Action, and Uſe.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the organicall parts, there is three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts, governing all the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Braine, Heart, and Liver, becauſe from them, ſome force, power, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty proceeds and flowes over the whole body, when as there is no ſuch ſent from any other part. To theſe ſome adde the teſticles, not for that they are of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the individuall or peculiar body, but for genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſervation of the ſpecies: Herein we may ſee the induſtry of nature, who like a good Architect ſeeks not only to build, and furniſh her fabricke with all kinde of materialls neceſſary, by which the body may live; but alſo ſhe hath furniſhed it with the teſticles, thereby to make it immortall, becauſe hereby every one may ſubſtitute another in his place before he depart
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41683:32"/> this world. The veines, arteries, and nerves, are the firſt ſimple inſtrumentall parts: the veines <label>Veines.</label> ſpring all from the liver, the arteries <label>Arteries.</label> from the heart (except only the <hi>vena arterioſa</hi>) which hath its originall from the eight ventricle of the heart: it is called <hi>vena arterioſa</hi> 
                  <label>Vena arteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſa.</label> compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, &amp; therefore is not reckoned amongſt the ſimple inſtrumentall parts: for it is called a veine, becauſe it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes alimentary blood to the lungs; and arterious, becauſe like an artery it conſiſts of two coates, all the reſt conſiſt but of one coate, knit together with a triple kinde of <hi>fibres,</hi> and this veine hath two principall cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, one by which the Chylus is carried to the liver, and is called <hi>vena porta,</hi> 
                  <label>Vena porta.</label> or the gate veine; the other by which the blood made out of the Chylus is diſperſed amongſt all the members for nouriſhment, and is called <hi>vena cava,</hi> 
                  <label>Vena cava.</label> the hollow veine. The gate veine hath its originall in the blunt end or lower end of the liver, and there it ſpreads its rootes: The hollow veine beginneth in the gibbous part of the liver: The truncke of the gate veine is divided into two principall branches; the one is <hi>ſplenicus,</hi> which is carried to the ſpleene, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>meſentericus,</hi> which goes to the meſentery; it hath other ſmall ſlips that nouriſh the moſt part of the lower belly, and take their names from the parts they nouriſh; as that which nouriſhes the ventricle, is called <hi>graſtica, inteſtinalis,</hi> that nouriſhes the inteſtines; <hi>ciſtica</hi> which brings nouriſhment to the bladder of the gall; from the meſentery branch ſpring ſmall ſlips to the right gut, which makes the hemorroids: The truncke of the hollow veine is alſo divided into two branches; one is carried upwards to nouriſh the ſuperiour parts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is carried downward to nouriſh the inferiour.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41683:33"/>
               <p>An artery differs from a veine becauſe it conſiſts of two coates that the ſpirits may not be exhaled, and that it may not be broken by the continuall motion and beating; a veine beates very little or not at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A nerve.</label> A nerve is that which proceeding from the braine or ſpinall marrow hath ſence and motion; ſome partes of the body which have nerves have feeling alſo, but no voluntary motion; as the membranes, veines, arteries, guts, and all the entrailes: from the braine ariſe two ſoft nerves, which have feeling, the hard nerves ſpring from the ſpinall marrow, and are moving; from the braine proceed ſeven conjugations of nerves, from the ſpinall marrowe thirty paire, that is ſixty nerves, ſome nerves cannot be perceived to be hollow at all, it is a ſimple part of our body, bred and nouriſhed by a groſſe, and phlegmaticke humour.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The ſecond inſtruments.</label> Of the three firſt and ſimple inſtruments, veines, nerves, and arteries, and of the eight aforeſaid parts leaſt confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, being knit in due quantity, number, and ſcite, ſpring the ſecond inſtruments; amongſt which the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <label>Muſcles.</label> have the firſt place, as being the inſtruments of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion; which is performed ſix maner of waies: viz. upwards, downewards, forwards, backwards, to the right hand, and to the left hand; this is ſimple motion the ſecond voluntary motion is circularly, as when you lure a hauke you ſwinge your hand round. A muſcle conſiſts of veines, nerves, and arterious fleſh, and fibres, from which they receive nouriſhment, life, ſenſe, and motion: they are reckoned amongſt the ſecond inſtruments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conſiſt of a coate, a tendon, and a ligament; and are devided into three partes, the begining, middle, and end, the head, inſertion and neather parte; and theſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41683:33"/> are all differing in figure, ſcituation, perforation, and quantity, colour, and connexion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The fingers.</label> The fingers conſiſt not only of veines of which they are nouriſhed, of arteries from whence they receive ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and vitall heate, nerves by which they feele, and muſcles whereby they are mooved; but alſo of three bones in each finger (that is fifteene in each hand, which are hollow, fiſtulous, and full of thinne and liquid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and not of groſſe and thick as in the arme or thigh) whereby they are fortified and ſuſtained; likewiſe of ligaments whereby the bones are connexed, of fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſh, and skin; by whoſe coniunction is ordained, the true organicall touching, the fingers are in number five. The nailes are generated by the fibers of the ligaments, and the excrements of the tendons, which are termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the bottom of the nailes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The hand.</label> The hand conſiſts of five fingers, the palme or hollow of the hand, the back of the hand, and the wreſt; it is the inſtrument of inſtuments, made for to take up and hold any thing, for with the hands are all the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments made; it is devided into five fingers the more eaſily to take up even the leaſt bodies of any figure or faſhion ſoever; and to this end nature ordained us the nailes, becauſe the fingers ends being ſoft fleſh, might not turne away in meeting with a hard body.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The heart.</label> The heart is the chiefe manſion of the ſoule, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane of the vitall faculty; and is placed in the body as the Sun in the firmament: it is placed by nature as it were in a box, that it may have free liberty to ſpread it ſelfe, and receive hurt neither from the ribs, or vertebres of the cheſt; it containes a continuall moiſture, that by its motion and heat, it may not be over dried; it conſiſts of a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41683:34"/> hard and denſe fleſh, in which are two hollowes, the right ſide is the biggeſt, the left ſide is the more corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and thereby the more ſtraite, but it is the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and thick, that the vitall ſpirits which are worked in it may not be exhaled: In the right hollow are two veſſels, a branch of the hollow veine whereby the heart drawes the bloud from the liver, and the gate veine by which it ſends the bloud throughly concocted, and ſubtilized to the lunges. In the left ſide alſo are two veſſels, the great Artery <hi>Aorta,</hi> whereby it ſends the vitall ſpirits every way, and the <hi>arteria venoſa,</hi> whereby it receives the aire from the lunges, which are only the bellowes of the heart to coole it. The heart hath <hi>auricles</hi> or little eares on every ſide, to hold up the gate vein, and branch of the hollow veine, that they be not broken by the violent motion of the heart; the heart is one alone ſcituate moſt commonly upon the fourth <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the cheſt, being placed there by nature, becauſe it is the moſt ſure and armed place; and is beſides, as it were, covered on every ſide by the hands of the lunges, and is made of a more denſe, ſolid, and compact ſubſtance, then any other part of the body, becauſe it muſt have a naturall motion of its ſelfe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Faculty is a certaine power, and efficient cauſe proceeding from the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the part, and the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of proceed the actions and powers of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The animall faculty.</label> Of theſe are three kindes in every perfect body; that is, the Animall, Vitall, and Naturall, which have a certaine ſimpathy one with another; for if one be hurt all the reſt ſuffer with it. The Animall is that which proceeds from the proper temperament of the braine, and yields knowledge, ſenſe, and voluntary motion; and this is of three kindes: 1. Moving, which remaines in the Muſcles and Nerves, as the fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of voluntary motion. 2. Senſative, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the five externall ſenſes, Sight, Hearing, Taſte, Smell, and Touch. 3. and principall, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the reaſonable faculty, the memory, and fantaſie. The Animall faculty being thus ſeated in the braine, ſends from thence ſence and motion by the nerves or certaine chanels into the whole body: <label>Vitall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</label> But the Vitall faculty is that which ſendeth life to every member of the whole body, and maintaines the eſſence of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and this hath his ſeat in the heart, from whence he ſends heat through the arteries to every part of the body, and is much hindred by diſeaſes in the breaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</label> The naturall faculty is that which carries the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41683:35"/> into all the members of the body, and this claimes his place in the liver; it is by <hi>Avicen</hi> and moſt of the ancient Philoſophers concluded, that this naturall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is divided into two parts, whereof one is the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of life and health unſeparable, and to nouriſh the body as comming from the fountaine and mint of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; the other is the preſerving and maintaining the forme and ſpecies made in generation: Firſt, by drawing the ſeminall matter from the humours of the body, and converting it into the humour called <hi>inomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata humiditas.</hi> Secondly, by forming this ſeminall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the veſſels and teſticles. Thirdly, by reducing the ſeminall matter into ſimple members. Fourthly, by forming it (at the command of the Creator) into his Image and likeneſſe: but I will only ſhwe you what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties attend on theſe before named; and for the reſt I ſhall referre the deſirous to <hi>Galen in libro de Hippocrat. &amp; Platonicis dogmat. li.</hi> 9. <hi>de curan. morb. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp; lib. de potent. natural.</hi> It being more then my brevity will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>Thoſe faculties therefore that attend the forenamed three, are in number foure, <hi>viz.</hi> Attractive, Retentive, Digeſtive, and Expulſive: The Attractive drawes that juice which is moſt fit to nouriſh the body by heate, and as it were a kinde of violence, and is made three man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies; 1. by heat, 2. likeneſſe of ſubſtance, 3. and to fill up vacant places; it is ſaid to be by heat, as when frictions and rubbings are applied to any part of the body, hot emplaſters or veſicatories, by which the native heate is encreaſed, and nouriſhment is drawne to the part, after which manner all the other parts draw: The likeneſſe of ſubſtance is a certaine inexplicable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41683:35"/> following the ſame forme, and ſimilitude, as you may perceive in the loadſtone, amber, and purgations, which draw nouriſhment from the part, not confuſedly, and indifferently, but definitly and with a deſire even as a familiar friend; a part therefore drawes nouriſhment by heat, but by the ſimilitude of ſubſtance it drawes this or that nouriſhment ſuch as is moſt fit for it, as the braine drawes phlegmaticke blood, the lunges chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke blood; after this manner the liver drawes the Chyle, the reines, the urine, for every one drawes that it may get thereby, as the bladder of the gall drawes the gall, and delights in it becauſe of the ſimilitude of the ſubſtance and the propriety of the matter received to the place receiving. Now the attraction to fill up vacant places is made by the deſire the naturall parts have to ſhunne the fault of vacancy, ſo that the light are carried downewards, and the heavy are raiſed upwards, by the ordination of nature; to that end, and in this manner doe the heart, arteries, and lunges attract aire to temper, and qualifie the native heat.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the parts cannot enjoy their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they have acquired, unleſſe the attracted be ſomewhile ſtaied, for every action hath his time, therefore nature like a good and skilfull workeman hath given every part a faculty of holding and retaining the nouriſhment, untill it be made perfect by concoction into the forme of Chyle, it is helped by coldneſſe and dryneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Digeſtive faculty.</label> The digeive faculty, is that which turnes the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (brought in by the attractive faculty and retained by the retentive faculty) into a fit ſubſtance, for that part whoſe faculty it is, as from the ſtomacke the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41683:36"/> is turned into Chyle, from Chyle the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive faculty in the meſeraicke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> veines, turnes it into blood, which by a third kinde is brought to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and aſſimulated to them and converted into the ſame ſubſtance, as may be perceived in the paps of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and teſticles of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Expulſive faculty.</label> And becauſe from aboundance of excrements pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed many dangerous diſeaſes, and that no nouriſhment whatſoever but hath his faeces, therefore hath nature placed the expulſive faculty, which is only appointed to exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll thoſe ſuperfluities, which by no action of heat can obtaine the forme of the part; and thus the wombe at the appointed time doth ſend forth the infant by a moſt vehement expulſive faculty. Now if any of theſe faculties be wanting in a body, the health muſt needs decay for want of nouriſhment; but if theſe faculties doe rightly performe their duties, then the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is changed into the proper ſubſtance of the part, and truly aſſimulated to it.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41683:36"/> there will be no action: Theſe actions are three in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Animall, Vitall, and Naturall, which are called alſo Simple, and Compound; <label>Simple actions.</label> ſimple, to whom one alone operative faculty with its naturall inſtruments doth concurre; as,

                     <item>Attraction. which is cauſed of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Attractive. by Heat and drineſſe.</item>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Compound actions.</label> The compound is made either of two faculties, as the naturall deſire of meat proceeds from the attractive, and ſenſative faculty, by which the ſtomackes feeles empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for five naturall motions goe before the naturall deſire: As Firſt, the emptinſſe of the members: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Attraction or ſucking of the members by the veines: Thirdly, the attraction of the veines from the liver: Fourthly, the ſucking of the liver from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke by the meſeraicke veines: Fithly, the ſenſe and feeling in the ſtomacke, from whence proceedes the naturall deſire of meat. This compound may be made of more then two faculties; as the carrying, which is as much to ſay as the helping forward of the nouriſhment in its paſſage to the members, and the egeſtion of the excrements and urine, which is made three waies; by the ſenſative that feeles the burthen; by the appetitive, or deſiring, which deſires to be eaſed; and the expulſive which expelleth and driveth the excrement to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Naturall actions.</label> Actions are either voluntary or naturall; the naturall are performed againſt our will, as the continuall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pulſation of the heart and arteries, and expulſion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41683:37"/> of excrements, and theſe actions flow from the liver and veines, or from the heart and arteries; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they called naturall and vitall actions. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary vitall actions be the dilatation &amp; contraction of the heart and arteries which we commonly call pulſe, by that they draw in, and by this they expell or drive forth. The unvoluntary vitall actions be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which proceedeth from the generative faculty, and growth, and nutrition, which proceedeth from the growing and nouriſhing faculty.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Generation.</label> Generation is a producing of matter, and introducing of a ſubſtantiall forme into the ſaid matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Growth.</label> Growth is an inlarging of the ſolid parts retaining ſtill both the figure and ſolidity, as the bones whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the whole body followes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Nutrition.</label> Nutrition is a perfect aſſimulation of that nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is digeſted into the nature of the part which digeſts, and is performed by the foure aforeſaid acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Attractive, Retentive, Digeſtive, and Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Voluntary motions.</label> The voluntary motions we willingly performe, are three; the ſenſative action, the moving action, and the principall: The ſenſative comprehends all the five ſenſes; ſight, hearing, taſte, ſmell, and touch, to the performance whereof neceſſarily occurre theſe three; 1. the organe, 2. the <hi>medium,</hi> or meane, 3. the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>The organe is the animall ſpirit diffuſed all over the body; the meane carries the object to the inſtrument; the object is an externall quality that can by a medicine ſtirre up the organe; as for example, ſight is the ſeeing faculty, acted by the eye which is the organe; the object
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41683:37"/> is the viſible quality before the eye, the <hi>medium</hi> arrives the object at the eye.</p>
               <p>The hearing faculty whereof the eare is the organe, every ſound the object, the <hi>medium</hi> is the ayre that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the ſound to the eare.</p>
               <p>The ſmelling faculty commeth from the mammillary proceſſes produced from the proper ſubſtance of the braine, and ſeated in the upper part of the noſe, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is every ſmell; the <hi>medium</hi> by which it is carried, is to men, birds, and beaſts the aire, to fiſhes the water.</p>
               <p>The action of the taſte is performed by the tongue; the object is the taſte of ſeverall meats and drinkes; the <hi>medium</hi> is either externall, as is the ſpittle that doth moiſten the tongue, or internall, as the ſpongy fleſh of the tongue it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>All parts endued with a nerve, enjoy the ſenſe of touching, the object is every tractable quality, as heat, cold, roughneſſe, &amp;c. The <hi>medium</hi> is either the skin or the fleſh endued with thoſe nerves.</p>
               <p>The next action is voluntary motion, and is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a muſcle (as I ſhewed you in the Chapter of Parts or Members) either by extention, or contraction, upward, downeward, to the right hand, to the left hand, forward, or backward.</p>
               <p>The principall action is threefold; 1. Imagination, 2. Reaſon, 3. and Memory.</p>
               <p>Imagination is a certaine diſtinguiſhing apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Reaſon is a certaine judiciall eſtimation of things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <p>Memory is the ſure ſtorer of all things, as in a maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, which the minde oft unfolds.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Spirit is the ſubſtance ſubtle, and acrious of our body, bred of the moſt pure, and thinne bloud, and is the prime inſtrument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the members ſhall performe their office, and they abide moſt in the heart and arteries, in the braine, and nerves.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Diviſion of ſpirits.</label> The Spirits are divided into three parts; animall, vital, &amp; naturall; <label>Animall ſpirit.</label> the animall is ſeated in the braine for there it is prepared and made, and of which a great part is ſent to the eyes by the nerves optickes, and ſome to the eares, and divers other parts: this kind is called animall becauſe it is the chiefe, and prime inſtrument of life.</p>

                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itall ſpirit.</label> The vitall ſpirit hath his chief manſion in the left ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the heart, and in the arteries, and is made of the evaporation of the bloud, and furniſhed with matter from the aire which we draw in breathing, and is ſent from his ſeate in the heart through the channels of the arteries into the whole, for the conſervation of naturall heate.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Naturall ſpirit.</label> The naturall ſpirit is engendred in the liver and veines, and there remaines while the bloud is made, and other naturall operations perfected: the uſe of it is to helpe the concoction both of the whole body, and of each ſeverall part, and to carry blood, and heate to them.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41683:38"/>
               <p>Theſe ſpirits being diſſipated, we cannot hope for life, becauſe the flower therof is decaied, and waſted in their defect.</p>

               <p>Age, is a ſpace or part of our life, in which our bodies are ſubject to mutations, and of this I have ſufficiently ſpoken before.</p>
               <p>The Colour, ſhewes the temperament of the body, and the juſt proportion of humours; as if there be a juſt proportion of the foure humours, the colour is red; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of melancholy, the colour is livide and blacke; if aboundance of choller, the colour is citrine and yellow; if phlegme, the colour is white and pale.</p>
               <p>Scite and figure, ſhew the good compoſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of all the parts of a body fitly and duely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted as they ought to be; of this kind there are foure, quadrature, craſſitude, or thickeneſſe, extenuation, and fatneſſe.</p>
               <p>Sex is the diſtinction betwixt Male and Female, not in parts, but in conſtitution; as the Male is commonly hot, the Female cold, and ſo are Eunuches.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>IRE is ſo neceſſary for us, that not one minute of health can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed without the ſame; as we may perceive by the continuall tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and breathing that all living creatures have for their refreſhing, and to regender the ſpirit animal, and therefore becauſe we ſo often draw it in &amp; breath it out, it wil be very neceſſary for our health to know what aire is wholeſome, and what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, for the aire doth alter our bodies three man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies; by quality, as if it be horter, moiſter, or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; by ſubſtance, as if it be more groſſer, or more ſubtle then is fit; or by mutation, which any man may prove who makes a ſuddaine change out of a quiet aire into a ſtormy, and that is troubled with winds.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The moſt healthfull Aire.</label> Therefore the moſt healthfull and beſt aire is that which is cleere, ſubtle, and pure, free, and open on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide, exempt from evill evaporations, fennes, ſinkes, cloudes, rotten and carrion like ſmells of dead carkaſſes, ſtanding pooles and all corruption, that is, neither is too hot, nor too cold, too drie nor too moiſt; and this aire is the beſt, both for the preſerving of health, and curing of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Evill Aire.</label> The evill aire is quite contrary to the good; as that which is putride, ſhut, &amp; preſt up in ſome narrow place, thicke, rotten, neere hills, ſtinkes, the ſea, and all ſuch
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41683:40"/> townes that ſtand low, and cloſe, infected with evill and noiſome ſavors; that which is nebulous, and expoſed to ſouth winde, and the mouldy putrified aire incloſed in unhabited dampe houſes and ſo wants ventulation, and it is the evill aire that cauſes townes ſcituate on or neare the ſea coaſt at the end of ſummer, and in the autumne, to be afflicted with the plague, and divers other dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous maladies.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>How the aire is changed.</label> Now the aire is changed five manner of waies; firſt by the time of the yeare, ſecondly by the ſtarres, thirdly by the windes, fourthly by the earth, and fiftly by fumes and vapors.</p>
               <p>Aire is changed by the time of the yeare, as in ſpring, ſummer, autumn, and winter; the ſpring maketh the aire temperate; the ſummer maketh it hot, and dry, which ought to be corrected by things that are cold, and moiſt; the autumne cold and dry; the winter cold, and moiſt, and muſt be all corrected by their contraries.</p>
               <p>Aire is changed by the ſtarres, by the proximity of the ſunne to them, or when the ſtarres approach neere the ſun, that is when they end their courſe ſooner then the ſunne, by whoſe nerves the aire is heate, and the further from the ſunne the colder it is.</p>
               <p>By the windes the aire is changed, for thoſe places have the healthfulleſt aire where the windes blow free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in champion countries, where the people live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more free from diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Aire is alſo changed by the earth, and that is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fould, the ſcituation and the compoſure; by the ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers waies, as the altitude produces cold at leaſt ſo farre as it is habitable, and likewiſe depth procures heat; latitude either in plaines or mountaines for the moſt part
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41683:40"/> cauſes temperate aire, but the aire of the ſouth moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines is cold, and unhabitable; but the north is hotter, becauſe of the reflection of the beames of the Sunne, eſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cially betwixt the north line, and Cancer: and the nearneſſe of the ſea changes the temperature of the aire, as thus: the ſouth ſea heats, and dries; the north ſea cooles, and dries: by compoſure of the country divers waies alſo is the aire changed, as by the nature wherof it conſiſts; as the rocky countries are cold, and drie; the durty clayey countries are cold and moiſt, &amp;c. according to the complexion of the matter it is compoſed of.</p>
               <p>Vapours and fumes of the earth alter the aire, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as proceed from fennes, moores, and other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tride places, from which an evill ſavour and breath is exhaled.</p>
               <p>Finally, becauſe aire is ſo powerfull in woundes and diſeaſes; the ancient Phiſitions councelled to change the aire if it might poſſibly be, if not, then to correct and accomodate it by art.</p>

In exerciſe, conſider firſt, the time, which is the fitteſt before meate: and ſecondly, the manner of the exerciſe which is generall, or particular; generall, as playing at ball, and leaping; particular, as when one part only is exerciſed; as walking exerciſes the legges, fighting the armes, riding ſtirres the belly, calling and ſpeaking loude exerciſes the lungs.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Leepe is a reſt and quietneſſe of the whole body, and the ceſſation of the ſpirits and faculty animall from ſenſe, and motion, fortifying the ſtrength, helping digeſtion, and correcting the paſſions of the minde; it is cauſed when the braines are poſſeſſed with vapours that aſcend, which by the coldneſſe of the braines are turned into humours, which cloſe the conduits of the nerves; for when we are waking, the animall f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>culties, as ſence, motion, and all are at worke; but when we are ſleeping, the natural functions are better performed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heate goes into the bowells where by is made digeſtion, which cannot be made by ſleepe in the day ſo well; for the Sunne drawes the heate and ſpirits into the outward part of the body; <label>Sleepe in the day is hurtfull.</label> and therefore ſleep in the day is counted hurtful, becauſe being wakened by noiſe, or by the attraction of the ſpirits by the Sun, the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction begunne is not perfected, but the ſtomacke filled with crudities, and ſower belchings, the braine filled with groſſe vapours and excrementitious humidities, and is the cauſe of divers ſickeneſſes, as catarrhes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But though ſleepe in the night time be counted and eſteemed wholeſome; yet except it be reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in certaine limits, it will prove otherwiſe; therefore eight houres is ſufficient, for longer time hinders the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41683:43"/> evacuation of the excrements, both upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and the naturall heate which is never idle, drawes from them ſome ill vapour into the veines and principall parts of the body, to become ſome matter for a diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>How to ſleepe.</label> Alſo in our lying downe to ſleepe we muſt obſerve this rule; firſt to lye one our right ſide, that the meat may fall more eaſily into the bottome of the ſtomacke, which is hotter; about an houre after is good to turne on the left ſide, that ſo the liver m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <label>Dreames.</label> By dreames we often know the humour that hath dominion, and is ſuperfluous in the body; for the ſanguine dreames are of marriages, mirth, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, gardens, and things pleaſant, and libidinous: Cholericke dreames are fiery, bright, ſhining, burning, full of noiſe, and contention: Phlegmaticke dreames are cold, of flouds, ſnowes, waters, ſhowers, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from high places: Melancholicke dreames are ſad, of caves, priſons, thicke darkeneſſe, ſmoakes and diſmall things.</p>

                  <label>Waking.</label> Much waking corrupteth the braine, and hurts the temperature thereof, debilitateth the ſenſes, alters the

               <p>
                  <label>Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</label> Evacuation is very neceſſary to prevent diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe excrements are the originall of divers, therefore it is chiefly commanded that the body be purged, &amp; exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; ſome excrements are good, which are only in quantity excrements, as ſeed and menſtruous blood; others are altogether unprofitable, which are excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both in quantity and quality, as ſweat, urine, and ordure, which are (as I have ſhewed you) generall, and the evacuation of the braine which is particular: Firſt therefore, the retention of the ſeed doth acquire the force of poiſon in the body, as it happens in young widdowes that ſuffer ſuffocation in the wombe; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the overmuch flowing thereof hurts the body as much, for they had as good loſe ſo much bloud: this you may perceive in ſparrows, which ſcarce are known to live above two yeares, and the males leſſe; therefore

               <p>The immoderate and overmuch uſe of venery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures divers diſcomodities, as the faintneſſe of the ſpirits, forgetfulneſſe, loſſe of ſight, ſtinking of the mouth, diſeaſes of the joynts, as trembling, palſey, gowtes of all kindes, both in feet, hands and fingers, crampes, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the reines, piſſing of bloud, ſhedding of urine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, and divers times the French pox, with exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration of the privities.</p>

                  <label>What a Simptome is.</label> 
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is (as I have ſhewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) three affects contrary to nature; the cauſe of a diſeaſe, the diſeaſe, and a ſimptome; the cauſe goeth before the diſeaſe, a ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome accompanies it, juſt as the ſhadow goeth with the body: in the generall ſignification it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any thing whatſoever that chanceth to man contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to nature, for whether it be cauſe, or a diſeaſe, yet if they come in a diſeaſe and are over, and above nature, they are properly called ſimptomes.</p>
               <p>There be three kinds of a ſimptome; firſt when the action is hurt, which may be done three waies, they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41683:48"/> aboliſhed; dulneſſe of ſight is a diminution or weakning thereof, and a ſuffuſion which hapneth in the beginning of a cataract is a deprivation of the ſight.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the immoderate evacuation or retention of excrements, as by retaining ſuch as ſhould be evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and expelling thoſe as ſhould be retained; as blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a ſound heathfull body that is not plethoricke, and retention of the courſes in women, urine, and ſtone in the bladder.</p>
               <p>The third is a ſimple affect of the body, or a mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome qualities contrary to nature, as the ſcabbe of the fleſh to a leproſie.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewed you the briefe introduction to the art of phyſick, wherof I have only gathered together the chiefe and principall heads, becauſe it is ſo largely diſcourſed on by others, yet out of ſuch a magazine, I thought it not amiſſe to extract a ſmall proportion, briefely to inſtruct the practitioner in the chiefeſt things belonging and neceſſarily to be conſidered in the adminiſtration of medicaments; for the chiefeſt thing that belongs to a Phyſition is to know the cauſes of thinges, which the antient Philoſophers got by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the fabrique; next I ſhall ſhew you the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome wordes difficult to bee underſtood, and ſo (as breifely as I can) proceed to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The effect of theſe qualities is diſtinguiſhed into theſe orders which we terme degrees, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a diſeaſe in the ſame meaſure and proportion; The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt degree doth alter and change ſomewhat obſcurely, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond manifeſtly, The third with great efficacy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and vehement labour, The fourth exceſſively alters and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> expells ſenſe by its violence.</p>
               <p>As for an example of Heat, warme water is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that which is a little hotter is in the firſt degree of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41683:55"/> heat, if manifeſtly hot, it is in the ſecond degree, but if heat more vehemently, it may be thought to come to the third, but if it ſcald, then it is arrived at the fourth degree of heate.</p>
               <p>Temperate Medicines be ſuch as doe manifeſtly nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heate, Coole, Moiſten, nor Dry; intemperate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are thoſe that are plainly hot or cold.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond faculties of Medicines depend upon the firſt, as of heate to rarifie, attract, open, attenuate, levigate, cleanſe; on the contrary, as of cold to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe, repercuſſe, ſhut up, incraſſate, exaſperate, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate; of moiſture, to ſoften and relaxe; of drineſſe, to harden and ſtiffen.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third faculty of Medicines is to agglutinate, fill with fleſh, to cicatrize, aſſwage paine, move or ſtay Vrine, Milke, Seed, Courſes, Sweate, Vomits, and the like. The generation of fleſh proceeds from two of the faculties, drying, and cleanſing, heate only mittigateth paine.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fourth faculty of Medicines is that which cauſeth the Medicine to worke upon one part or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and not upon another, as ſome purge the head, ſome the ſtomack, ſome the gutts, ſome phlegme, ſome melancholy, and the like.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41683:56"/> as halfe a pound, one pound, or three quarters of a pound: As for example, Take Mallowes, Violets, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaea, leaves of Willow, water Lillies, ſeethe them, and put to the decoction <hi>Caſsia fiſtula,</hi> Sugar, oyle of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and of Roſes, which profiteth much in Strangury. The manner of giving a Gliſter is thus; when it is ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cooled ſufficiently, you ſhall have the pipe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with a bladder and a corke fitted to the pipe, with a thred to pull it out when you have put up the pipe, then ſtop the pipe with the corke, and poure the decoction into the bladder, and tie the bladder faſt, and let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient put it up into his fundament, lying on his bed, on his right ſide, and nothing about his belly to gird it, then pull out the corke by the thred, and with the hand by little and little cruſh up the Gliſter, and let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it about halfe an houre if he can.</p>

After what manner ſoever your Bathes be made, they muſt alwayes be warme; for warm Water humects, and mollifies the ſolid parts, if at any time they be too dry, or hard: it is good againſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning and Wearineſſe, alſo if we finde our ſelves too hot, or too cold, or loathing of Meats, we find great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in Bathes made of ſweet warme Water. Herein wee uſually adde Oyle, becauſe Water alone will not ſo long adhere to the Body: they are good in Hecticke Feavers, and in the declenſion of all Feavers, and againſt raving and talking idlely, for they procure ſleepe; againſt inflammation of the Lungs and Sides, for they mitigate paine. For Bathes we chuſe Raine Water, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then River Water, ſo it be not muddy, and then Fountaine; the Water of Lakes, and Fennes, is not to be uſed.

               <p>THoſe Sirrups that you make by infuſion of Flowers, to every pinte of Water you muſt adde foure ounces of Flowers, and theſe muſt be done in Pipkins of earth well glaſed, or in Veſſels of Pewter, or Silver, with narrow mouthes, that may be ſtopped cloſe, and not in Braſſe nor Copper. In making Sirrup of Roſes and Violets, &amp;c. which are made with many infuſions, it will be good that the firſt infuſion be made with ſcalding water powred on them, the reſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions with warme water. Boile your Sirrups ſoftly upon a cleere Charcoale fire, taking it from the fire when it is boiled, and with a Spoone full of holes ſcum it cleane; you ſhall know when it is boiled enough by the breath which comes out very ſtrongly at firſt, but when it is almoſt enough, the fume will ſcarce appeare at all: alſo if you take a little in a Spoone, and let it fall, if it make a thread, it is enough, elſe not; when it is almoſt cold put it in a Pot, and cover it with a Paper perforated with a Needle; and when it is quite cold cover it with a leather, and keepe it in a temperate place.</p>
